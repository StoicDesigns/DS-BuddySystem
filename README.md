## What is 5MWW3
The basic premise of 5MWW3 is simple: you and up to 6 friends can drop into Los Santos in search of loot, completing missions and finding gear to earn rewards you can then become the top Squad! As well as AI soldiers you'll be competing against other players you run into.

You can leave any time you want just now The danger is that if you die you lose everything you have on you, from the gear you brought in, to anything you pick up that game. 



## Do I need the Launcher?
No thankfully you do not NEED the launcher, yet we recommend that you use our launcher as it comes with updates, forms, tickets, etc! The biggest help is a direct connect feature for you and your friends!
